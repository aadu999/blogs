This is a small attempt to make a facial recognition system using K Nearest Neighbor algorithm. We will be using OpenCV, Numpy and some other python packages. <!--more--> Initially we've to create a KNN Classifier from the scratch, Those who don't Know much about KNN classifier please read [this](https://google.com).

kindly make sure you've installed Numpy and Open CV

```shell
pip3 install numpy opencv-python
```

As the name recommends this calculation is pertinent for Regression issues. Linear Regression is a Linear Model. Which implies, we will build up a linear connection between the information variables(X) and single yield variable(Y). At the point when the input(X) is a solitary variable this model is called Simple Linear Regression and when there are mutiple input variables(X), it is called Multiple Linear Regression.

### Simple Linear Regression
We discussed that Linear Regression is a simple model. Simple Linear Regression is the simplest model in machine learning

### Model Representation
In this problem we have an input variable - X and one output variable - Y. And we want to build linear relationship between these variables. Here the input variable is called Independent Variable and the output variable is called Dependent Variable. We can define this linear relationship as follows:
